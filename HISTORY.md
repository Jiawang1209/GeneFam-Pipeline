- User request or reason for the change.

Decisions:
- Durable design or implementation choices.

Added:
- Files or features added.

Modified:
- Files or behavior changed.

Deleted:
- Files or behavior removed.

Verification:
- Commands, checks, or review performed.

Commit:
- hash: <commit hash, or "not created in this session">
- message: <commit subject, if any>
- files: <brief changed-file summary, if any>

Next:
- Follow-up items or open questions.
```

## 2026-06-23 - Project governance and single-file development diary setup

Context:
- The user asked to add project development constraints before deeper implementation.
- Required files: `AGENT.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- The user clarified that development history should be recorded in one file, with dates and a clear list of what was added, modified, or deleted.

Decisions:
- Use `AGENT.md` as the project-wide instruction file for AI/development agents.
- Use `CLAUDE.md` as Claude-specific orientation while pointing back to `AGENT.md`.
- Use this root-level `HISTORY.md` as the single durable development diary.
- Record commit hash and commit message whenever a commit is created.

Added:
- `AGENT.md` with project direction, scientific cautions, repository practices, and required history updates.
- `CLAUDE.md` with Claude-specific guidance.
- `HISTORY.md` with the required single-file history format and this initial entry.

Modified:
- Updated `AGENT.md` to require history entries in `HISTORY.md`.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to require history entries in `HISTORY.md`.

Deleted:
- Removed `history/README.md`.
- Removed `history/2026-06-23.md`.

Verification:
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `HISTORY.md` after creation/update.

Commit:
- hash: not created in this session
- message: none
- files: documentation only

Next:
- Continue with the formal pipeline design document or scaffold the Nextflow MVP after user confirmation.

## 2026-06-23 - Add integrated development plan

Context:
- The user asked to integrate previous discussion into a development plan.
- The plan needed to reflect Nextflow as the workflow engine, YAML-driven species selection from a large species bank, and duplication-aware evolution analysis.

Decisions:
- Save the implementation plan under `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
- Structure development as a staged MVP first, followed by advanced downstream modules.
- Keep named WGD event annotation separate from automatic duplicate classification and anonymous WGD layer inference.

Added:
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-genefam-pipeline.md`

Modified:
- `HISTORY.md`

Deleted:
- none

Verification:
- Reviewed `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-genefam-pipeline.md`.
- Searched `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-genefam-pipeline.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `AGENT.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` for stale dated-history rules and unresolved plan markers.
- Confirmed the relevant new files are currently untracked with `git status --short -- AGENT.md CLAUDE.md HISTORY.md docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-genefam-pipeline.md`.

Commit:
- hash: not created in this session
- message: none
- files: planning documentation

Next:
- Review the plan and decide whether to begin with Task 1 repository skeleton and input contract.

## 2026-06-23 - Implement Nextflow MVP scaffold and Python helpers

Context:
- The user asked to start a long-running development pass under a concrete goal so the project would have useful developed content by morning.
- Work followed the integrated development plan and prioritized a usable MVP scaffold.

Decisions:
- Keep `Reference/` untouched and exclude it from this development checkpoint.
- Use TDD for Python behavior-bearing helpers.
- Keep genome FASTA example patterns explicit instead of broad `*.fa` patterns to avoid mistaking protein FASTA files for genome FASTA files.
- Record missing local bioinformatics binaries as environment limitations rather than blocking Python-level development.

Added:
- `.gitignore`
- `configs/example.config.yaml`
- `configs/species_groups.yaml`
- `configs/wgd_events.brassicaceae.yaml`
- `schemas/config.schema.yaml`
- `docs/input_contract.md`
- `docs/duplication_retention_design.md`
- `bin/__init__.py`
- `bin/genefam/__init__.py`
- `bin/genefam/discover_species.py`
- `bin/genefam/validate_config.py`
- `bin/genefam/parse_hmmer_domtbl.py`
- `bin/genefam/merge_identification_evidence.py`
- `bin/genefam/extract_sequences.py`
- `bin/genefam/summarize_family.py`
- `bin/genefam/classify_wgd_layers.py`
- `workflows/nextflow.config`

- `workflows/modules/hmmer_search.nf`

- `scripts/plot_family_counts.R`
- `scripts/plot_kaks.R`
- `scripts/plot_expression_heatmap.R`
- `report/template.qmd`
- pytest fixtures under `tests/fixtures/species_bank/`
- pytest coverage for species discovery, config validation, HMMER parsing, evidence merging, FASTA extraction, family summary, and WGD layer classification.

Modified:
- `README.md`
- `HISTORY.md`
- `configs/example.config.yaml`
- `docs/input_contract.md`

Deleted:
- none

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests -q` passed with 14 tests.
- `python bin/genefam/validate_config.py configs/example.config.yaml` returned `Configuration OK`.
- `python bin/genefam/discover_species.py --config configs/example.config.yaml --groups configs/species_groups.yaml --out /tmp/genefam_species_manifest.tsv` created a 3-line manifest.
- Checked local tool availability: `nextflow`, `hmmsearch`, and `diamond` were not found in PATH.
- `Rscript` exists at `/usr/local/bin/Rscript`, but both the family-count plotting smoke test and `Rscript --version` failed to return promptly in this environment and were stopped.

Commit:
- hash: c3621758f608819296db602f9e5d6659e5bdbf80
- message: feat: scaffold genefam pipeline mvp
- files: project scaffold, docs, Python helpers, tests, workflow modules, report scripts

Next:
- Install or expose Nextflow, HMMER, DIAMOND, and a responsive Rscript environment before full external-tool workflow verification.
- Wire parsed HMMER/DIAMOND outputs through the full Nextflow graph once Nextflow is available.
